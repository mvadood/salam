# SALAM (SociAL Agent-based Modeling)
**SALAM** is very simple framework which was written primarily to facilitate the process of evaluating different information diffusion/opinion dynamics models within social networks.
It makes use of [graph-tool](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool) to represent and visualize a graph.

There's a lot of stuff that can be done to make the project really usable. But on the other hand, there's a nice project [here (mesa)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) that includes a lot of the features that I had in mind to implement. So, I suggest that every one interested in Agent-based modeling within social networks adopt the ideas of SALAM and try to contribute to mesa to make it support graphs better.
